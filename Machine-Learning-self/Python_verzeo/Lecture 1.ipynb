Hence, it has quite the steep learning curve. You know the machine understands zeros and ones. So imagine having to write lines of code that is almost in that binary form. You need to check the memory usage of your code, how your code is stored, how that affects performance, write some algorithms to improve performance of the program. In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program. Higher-level means it’s more readable to humans and less readable to computers. Likewise, Lower-level means less readable for humans and more readable for computers.\n","\n","Interpreted Language - Interpreted in simple terms means running code line by line. It also means that the instruction is executed without earlier compiling the whole program into machine language. There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++. Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes which is then translated into native language of specific computer to run it. If you commit a mistake at the end of your program, you will find that there is an error generated for obvious reasons but along with the error, you will find the output of the program till the line of the program was correct.\n","\n","Dynamically Typed - Everything in Python is an Object.
